15-112 Term Project - Space worms
Jun Su Jang

The aim of this project was to incorporate few different features of the games with similar themes

(namely, tank, gunbound, angry birds) to come up with a whole new game. My game is called "Space Worms"


Open SpaceWorm_1.2.py to play the game (old versions are not part of the final product but just there)

To watch the video, open:

The tools used are as follows:
	-python 2.7
	-python image library(PIL) for python version 2.7
	Within in python, import:
		-Tkinter,
		-import tkMessageBox
 		-tkMessageBox
 		-tkSimpleDialog
		-PIL.Image
 		-ImageTk
		-random
		-math

Note: PIL is much easier to install on window than mac. Recommended to use Windows.



The images used in this games were from the following sources on the internet:
